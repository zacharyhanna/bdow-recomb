## StrOccCau2-methods

After completing the assembly, we performed the following steps:

* We first screen the assembly for contaminant sequences.

See this [contamination screen methods README](https://github.com/zacharyhanna/StrOccCau2-methods/blob/master/contamination-screen/README.md) for details on the methodology we followed to screen the assembly for contaminants and remove them.

* We then performed repeat-masking of the assembly to identify repetitive regions as well as low complexity regions.

See [repeat_methods.md](repeat_methods.md) for details of the methdology.

* We next annotated the assembly.
