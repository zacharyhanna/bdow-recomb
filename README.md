## StrOccCau2-methods

After completing the assembly, we performed the following steps:

* We first screened the assembly for contaminant sequences.

    - See [contamination screen methods README](https://github.com/zacharyhanna/bdow-recomb/blob/master/contamination-screen/README.md) for details on the methodology we followed to screen the assembly for contaminants and remove them.

* We then performed repeat-masking of the assembly to identify repetitive regions as well as low complexity regions.

    - See [repeat masking methods README](https://github.com/zacharyhanna/bdow-recomb/blob/master/repeat-masking/README.md) for details of the repeat-masking methodology.


## Variant calling

* See [variant calling methods README](https://github.com/zacharyhanna/bdow-recomb/blob/master/variant-calling/README.md) for details of the methodology we used to call variants.

## Summary statistics

* See [summary statistics methods README](https://github.com/zacharyhanna/bdow-recomb/blob/master/summary-stats/README.md) for details of the methodology.

## Recombination rate estimation methods

* See [recombination rate estimation methods README](https://github.com/zacharyhanna/bdow-recomb/blob/master/recombination-rate/README.md) for details of the recombination-rate methodology.
